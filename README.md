# inlandUI
Patagonia Inland is a self-initiated project focused on providing employees of the clothing company Patagonia a way to connect and learn about each other internally. This project was inspired by my past experiences of working in retail and wanting to get to know my fellow colleagues living in other places.

This prototype is a work in progress, view the mocks here: http://matthewmatthew.com/work/PatagoniaInland
